  abstract = {Efficient ground handling at airports contributes significantly to the performance of the entire air transport network. In this network, airports are coupled by flights that depend on passenger and crew connections, effective local airport operations, and efficient ground handling resource management. In addition, airport stakeholders must consider different time scales (look-ahead times), process estimates, and both bounded and multiple-dependent solution spaces for their decision-making processes. In this context, we aim to solve the NP-hard problem of combined aircraft turnaround time and airport gate allocation optimization. We developed a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on the Shuffled Frog-Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) and the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA). Our hybrid SFLA-GOA approach overcomes the drawback of each algorithm and achieves a preferred solution at a reduced computational cost. We test our approach with a scenario derived from Frankfurt Airport operations, including gate positions, terminal layout, and flight plan information. In all defined problem sizes, the hybrid SFLA-GOA algorithm outperforms an independent implementation of the SFLA algorithm. Also, the SFLA-GOA algorithm provides an improved solution by at least nearly 12\% up to 40\% over the standard mixed-integer programming solvers.},

The solution of this problem has raised a significant research effort and many variants of this problem have been studied. In this paper, we review past work with a focus on identifying types of formulations, classifying objectives, and categorising solution methods. The review indicates that there is no standard formulation, that passenger oriented objectives are most common, and that more recent work are multi-objective. In terms of solution methods, heuristic and metaheuristic approaches are dominant which provides an opportunity to develop exact and approximate approaches both for the single and multi-objective problems.},

  abstract = {The continued growth in the civil aviation industry leads to more traffic in the airport, resulting in a decline in operational efficiency and the travel experience of passengers. Studying how to improve operational efficiency and keep passenger satisfaction simultaneously is very significant. This study proposes to use total passenger boarding distance instead of total passenger walking distance to quantify passenger satisfaction and then model the airport stand assignment problem considering these two different objectives together with the gated percentage, respectively, and the NSGA-II algorithm is improved for a better solution speed. This study also performs a case study by applying a dataset of an airport in China. The results of the case study prove that using the total passenger boarding distance can help the airport better balance operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction, which can help provide theoretical support for airport management.},

  abstract = {Assigning aircraft to gates is one of the most important daily decision problems that airport professionals face. The solution to this problem has raised a significant effort, with many researchers tackling many different variants of this problem. However, most existing studies on gate assignment contain only a static perspective without considering possible future disruptions and uncertainties. We bridge this gap by looking at gate assignments as a dynamic decision-making process. This paper presents the Real-time Gate Assignment Problem Solution (REGAPS) algorithm, an innovative method adept at resolving pre-assignment issues and dynamically optimising gate assignments in real-time at airports through the integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This work represents the fist time that DRL is used with real airport data and a configuration containing a large number of flights and gates. The methodology combines a tailored Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation with the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) architecture. Multiple factors, such as flight schedules, gate availability, and passenger walking time, are considered. An empirical case study demonstrates that the REGAPS outperforms two classic deep Q-learning algorithms and a traditional Genetic Algorithm in terms of reducing passenger walking time and apron gate assignment. Finally, supplementary experiments highlight REGAPS's adaptability under various gate assignment rules for international and domestic flights. The finding demonstrates that not only did REGAPS outperform COVID restrictions, but it can also produce considerable benefits under other policies.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications, where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on the existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art GNNs into four categories, namely, recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and spatial–temporal GNNs. We further discuss the applications of GNNs across various domains and summarize the open-source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of GNNs. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

  abstract = {To address the issues of inefficient resource allocation and severe ground congestion at hub airports during aircraft turnaround operations, a two-stage optimization model is constructed to coordinate the scheduling of stands and ground support vehicles. The model focuses on analyzing the scheduling rules, operational patterns, and collaborative mechanisms between stand allocation and ground support vehicles, taking into account the coupling relationship between airport operational and support resources. The pre-allocation of stands is conducted under the constraints of limited support resources, and the results are used as inputs for ground support vehicle scheduling. This combined optimization of stands and vehicle resources enhances the overall resource efficiency. The NSGA-II algorithm, combining local search strategies (LS-NSGA-II), is used to solve the model. Computational experiments conducted at Shenzhen Airport show some improvements: For the stand allocation model, the model incorporates ground support service constraints for tow tractors and driving distances for ferry buses, thereby avoiding potential service conflicts and resource wastage. Secondly, for the scheduling of vehicles, by analyzing the operational patterns and service characteristics of different vehicles, the model improved vehicle utilization efficiency by 37.5\%, reduced travel distance by 20.4\%, and decreased waiting times by 57.6\%, compared to the first-come-first-served strategy currently employed at airports.},
